# Plan 01-01: Update Storage Layer Default Path

## Goal

Change the default storage location from `~/.business-design/` to `.business-design/` in the current working directory.

## Tasks

- [ ] **T1**: Update `getDataDir()` to return `process.cwd()/.business-design` as default
- [ ] **T2**: Update tests to verify new default behavior
- [ ] **T3**: Run tests and ensure all pass

## Implementation Notes

**File:** `src/storage/index.ts`
**Current:** Line 30-32 returns `join(homedir(), ".business-design")`
**Change:** Return `join(process.cwd(), ".business-design")` as default

The `BUSINESS_DESIGN_DATA_DIR` env var override should continue working.

## Verification

```bash
npm test
```

All tests should pass with the new default path.
