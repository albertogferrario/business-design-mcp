# Plan 01-02: Add Home Directory Fallback

## Goal

Add backwards compatibility: if `.business-design/` doesn't exist in project but `~/.business-design/` does, use home directory.

## Tasks

- [ ] **T1**: Update `getDataDir()` to check for existing home directory data
- [ ] **T2**: Add logic: prefer project-local, fallback to home if it exists and has data
- [ ] **T3**: Add tests for fallback behavior
- [ ] **T4**: Run all tests

## Implementation Notes

**File:** `src/storage/index.ts`

Logic:
1. If `BUSINESS_DESIGN_DATA_DIR` env var is set, use that (existing behavior)
2. If `process.cwd()/.business-design/` exists, use that
3. Else if `~/.business-design/` exists, use that (backwards compat)
4. Else use `process.cwd()/.business-design/` (new projects)

This ensures existing users' data continues to work while new projects get project-local storage.

## Verification

```bash
npm test
```

All tests should pass including new fallback tests.
